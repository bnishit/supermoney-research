**Rohit:** Hi Pavan.

**Pavan:** Hi Rohit. How are you?

**Rohit:** I'm fine. How about you?

**Pavan:** I'm good.

**Rohit:** Pavan, I just wanted to talk to you and do a small research to understand how teenagers handle payments. So I'll be asking you a few questions. That'll be okay, right?

**Pavan:** Yeah, sure. That's fine.

**Rohit:** And the whole conversation will be recorded. Just for research purposes. It's not an issue. It's all right.

**Pavan:** Thank you.

**Rohit:** Okay, let's start. So, can you walk me through your normal day?

**Pavan:** Well, I wake up at 6 o'clock in the morning. I get ready, have some breakfast, and wait for my bus which I have to board at about 7 o'clock. By 9 o'clock, I'm in my university campus.

**Rohit:** You don't need to be that deep. You can casually answer all the questions.

**Pavan:** So I have classes, I take lunch and few more classes. I come back home. It's about 8 o'clock in the evening by the time I come home. By 11 o'clock I wind everything up and I make sure I'm good for the next day and I sleep.

**Rohit:** So what all apps do you use during the whole day?

**Pavan:** Spotify is a very big one. Spotify is a very big thing that I use. The other one is Instagram. Apart from these both, it's WhatsApp and Gmail. Because yeah, I keep getting university circulars and all I have to keep looking after that.

**Rohit:** Makes sense.

**Pavan:** And YouTube. Either for my educational purposes or any entertainment, YouTube goes well. So yeah, it's first Spotify, Instagram, followed by WhatsApp, YouTube, and Gmail.

**Rohit:** So when was the last time you paid for something?

**Pavan:** Two days back.

**Rohit:** What did you pay for?

**Pavan:** It was regarding the transportation, for the Rapido.

**Rohit:** Makes sense. So, how did you pay Rapido?

**Pavan:** I regularly use PhonePe for any of my payments. Sometimes I even carry cash but my major payments are done by PhonePe.

**Rohit:** So you prefer UPI over cash?

**Pavan:** Yeah. Recently I have been molding myself towards cash. But yeah, majority of my payments are done by UPI.

**Rohit:** That's actually interesting. Can you tell me why you are shifting to use cash?

**Pavan:** Cash because yeah, in my university campus, wherever I go, I don't have much facilities of internet. So yeah, it's a very big problem for students like me because it's totally outside the city. The internet facilities are too poor.

**Rohit:** So keeping cash is better than using UPI in universities?

**Pavan:** Yeah.

**Rohit:** I understand. So you mentioned about using PhonePe. So how did you come to know about PhonePe?

**Pavan:** It was at my 16 years when I started using PhonePe UPI. My mother had an account. She said I'll just deposit about two thousand per month for you so that you can use it. So yeah, that was when I started. My brother helped me using UPI. He was the first person who finished the process. He set that up in my mobile.

**Rohit:** Can I know what UPI apps your mother and brother were using?

**Pavan:** My mother, her major payments are done by GPay, Google Pay. And even she has PhonePe but she doesn't use it much. My brother also uses GPay more. Before he used to have FamPay, which is a UPI without any bank account. Before he gets his own bank account, he used to use FamPay. My brother, he uses GPay and PhonePe. I use PhonePe, but I have three of them like I have Paytm, GPay, and PhonePe. But I only use PhonePe.

**Rohit:** Which was the first app you downloaded?

**Pavan:** PhonePe itself.

**Rohit:** Can I understand why did you download Paytm and Google Pay also?

**Pavan:** Paytm and Google Pay, there is no particular reason. But actually, back then Paytm was giving much more rewards for freshers. I obtained a lot of rewards, about 200 rupees to 300 rupees I just purely got in the form of rewards. That's the main reason, rewards was one of the major reasons.

**Rohit:** Why Google Pay? I understand Paytm for rewards.

**Pavan:** Google Pay, I just created it. I never used it though. My mother was using Google Pay. Initially, I didn't have the proper knowledge how the UPI works. So I thought if my mother had to transfer any money to me, she could only transfer through Google Pay. She couldn't transfer to my PhonePe. I thought the transactions would be complicated.

**Rohit:** Can you walk me through your last three-four payments that you made with UPI?

**Pavan:** Me and my friends took a room. We rented... it's not rented, it's a lodge. We just took a room and much of the payments... first I paid for the room rent. And for the food. And there were actually much more expenses than room and food. It actually backfired on us. So I had to pay more for that.

**Rohit:** What backfiring?

**Pavan:** We initially expected it to be about 2,000 for the room. But we actually destructed the property. He charged us about 2,500 in excess.

**Rohit:** Got it. So if I may ask, what is the biggest payment transaction you did?

**Pavan:** Like for my use... I have done much bigger transactions like for my college fees. Are you asking on a regular basis or my highest UPI payment?

**Rohit:** I would like to know both.

**Pavan:** The highest must be my bus fees. It's 50,000. And the other one on regular basis, it's of course food. Regularly, it accumulates a lot because much of my pocket money is gone for food.

**Rohit:** So if I may also ask, do you track budgets on how much you spend in a month or something?

**Pavan:** I got a scholarship of 2,500 every month and my mother gives me an excess 1,500. The thousand rupees I just purely save that money for any other future activities or any enjoyment trips, excursions, or anything educational trips. That's my emergency fund.

**Rohit:** Do you at the end of the month track how much you are spending each month?

**Pavan:** Yeah, I do track how much I spend. I regularly check how much I've spent.

**Rohit:** So with respect to UPI, why have you only been using PhonePe for payments?

**Pavan:** I initially used to use Paytm for much reward as I mentioned. Slowly the reward rate decreased, started to decrease, and at a point it was nothing. It just used to give me some cashback points that wasn't much valued. And the payment duration was too late. The payments were more unsuccessful. That was a very big problem for me. So PhonePe was extremely comfortable regarding the payments. I didn't face much problems.

**Rohit:** So within these apps, do you use them only for payments or do you do anything else with these apps?

**Pavan:** I have even done few investments in gold and silver. And I purchase movie tickets. Sometimes whenever I go to metropolitan cities like Hyderabad or Bangalore, I purchase the metro tickets, metro rail tickets.

**Rohit:** Can you be more specific on which app do you use all this in?

**Pavan:** Metro tickets, it's all Paytm. Because that's more comfortable. Gold and silver, I have invested in PhonePe itself.

**Rohit:** What made you go invest in gold?

**Pavan:** I saw a very drastic raise in gold prices for a few months. So I thought of... I didn't invest much. I just invested about 500 to 600 rupees. I got some 60 or 70 rupees in back.

**Rohit:** How did you discover that you can buy gold from PhonePe?

**Pavan:** Whenever I finish my payments, there is a pop-up down regarding you can buy gold, you can invest in gold, you can make an SIP in gold.

**Rohit:** Got it. So because of pop-ups you got interested and you've invested?

**Pavan:** Yeah.

**Rohit:** Moving on in the conversation, can you tell me what you know about credit cards?

**Pavan:** A credit card... we first apply for the credit card and we can make payments through it. It gives us a limit of how much we can spend. Credit card is nothing but it's giving you a loan. He gives you a loan for a month. You can use it and you repay that. But the benefits of credit cards are very high and even the disadvantages are the same I feel. Because if you don't pay back on time, you have to pay interest and it's way bigger. The interest rate is very high. And I can get free lounge access in airports. You get movie tickets. Sometimes even the petrol... various credit cards have various benefits.

**Rohit:** Where did you learn about these things? How did you get to know about all these offers and stuff?

**Pavan:** Social media.

**Rohit:** Any particular platform?

**Pavan:** There is an Instagram account called "The Credit Card Guy." He always pops up on my reels and he keeps on explaining the benefits of each card. So I've gone through a few.

**Rohit:** Do you follow this guy?

**Pavan:** Yeah, I do follow him.

**Rohit:** We'll come back to the credit card guy in a while.

**Pavan:** Okay.

**Rohit:** Do you use credit cards?

**Pavan:** No, I don't use credit cards. I'm not eligible, I feel.

**Rohit:** Why do you think you're not eligible?

**Pavan:** First, we need to have a standard income. Is that true? I don't know. I haven't researched much about that. So I feel we need to have a standard income. I don't have a standard income, so yeah.

**Rohit:** Any of your friends use credit cards?

**Pavan:** Not like... people do use credit cards, but not of their own accounts. Their parents' accounts or their siblings' accounts.

**Rohit:** Got it. So what made you follow this credit card guy when you yourself didn't have credit cards?

**Pavan:** He used to pop up in my Instagram ads initially and first, his way of talking was very impressive. For the first time I started liking his content. And then it was a part of my algorithm, my Instagram reel algorithm. I was pretty interested in those beneficiaries the credit card gifts.

**Rohit:** Last question. When was there a time in your past where you wished, "Oh, I wish I had a credit card right now?"

**Pavan:** Yeah, when I was in Jaipur International Airport. All of my siblings were able to access the lounge, but I wasn't able to. All of my cousins were able to access the lounge, but I wasn't able to access the lounge. That was the time I felt if I had a credit card, even I could access the lounge.

**Rohit:** Anywhere else?

**Pavan:** I've seen the UPI credit card... do you have an idea? In my PhonePe itself, there is an ad that always pops up regarding SBI and HDFC credit cards. It's just a UPI based credit card. So I am eligible, but I haven't kept my keen interest on it.

**Rohit:** Why is that?

**Pavan:** First, my parents don't allow me to use a credit card. I have just had a conversation about credit cards. They weren't much happy... especially my father, he wasn't much happy of me speaking about credit card. He personally doesn't use any credit card and he even doesn't like using credit cards. Even if I ask him, I expect that he doesn't allow for me to use a credit card.

**Rohit:** That's about all the questions I had. Thank you for taking your time.

**Pavan:** It's all right.
