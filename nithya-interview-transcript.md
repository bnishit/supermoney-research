**Ruin:** Hello Nithya.

**Nithya:** Hello.

**Ruin:** Hi Nithya. Can you hear me?

**Nithya:** Yeah, hi.

**Ruin:** Thanks for taking your time for the survey.

**Nithya:** Yeah, no problem.

**Ruin:** So, like I mentioned earlier, this call will be recorded for internal purposes and then just do some research on this. That is fine with you, right?

**Nithya:** Yeah, yeah. Sure.

**Ruin:** So, I'm actually doing a small research to understand how teenagers handle payments. So, I'll ask you a few questions.

**Nithya:** Okay.

**Ruin:** Cool. So, let's start. Can you just walk me through your normal day and what apps do you use mostly?

**Nithya:** Right. So, currently I'm 21 years of age. So, I am in my final year of college. So, my answers will be based on that. So, mostly in my campus and we use UPI for all our payments. So, it's mostly food or a few online shopping every now and then. Not only using much of cash. Anything in particular you want to know?

**Ruin:** Yeah, Nithya. I just wanted to let you know that you could be free. Like, don't be very professional. I just wanted to understand what are the different apps you use. Not just payment apps. Any apps that you use in your day-to-day life.

**Nithya:** Okay. So, for communication and social media, I think WhatsApp and Instagram primarily. And sometimes also check out my LinkedIn every now and then. And I also use the basic apps like Gmail, Photos, Google Chrome. And also YouTube for entertainment for sure. And a few productivity apps. Like, I do have Notion with me and Docs and Google Sheets, etc. I also do a bit of investment. So, I do have Kite with me.

**Ruin:** Interesting.

**Nithya:** Yeah. And also, online shopping apps. Starting from Amazon to Flipkart, Meesho, Nykaa, Myntra, Ajio, you know, basically wherever I get offers from. I do all of them. And yeah, Netflix, Amazon Prime.

**Ruin:** So, you did mention shopping. So, when you shop usually, how do you pay?

**Nithya:** Sorry, I didn't get that.

**Ruin:** So, when you're shopping, how do you pay?

**Nithya:** Yeah. UPI. I do not generally prefer cash on delivery because I might have classes. So, I would just tell the delivery guy to give it in my hostel.

**Ruin:** So, what UPI apps do you use?

**Nithya:** Hello?

**Ruin:** Hello. Yeah. I'm sorry. Your voice is not audible.

**Nithya:** I was asking you what UPI app do you use?

**Ruin:** What UPI apps do you use?

**Nithya:** UPI apps are I have two bank accounts. So, I use one bank account and I use one with Google Pay and usually SBI is down. So, I have another app with my HDFC account.

**Ruin:** So, both the accounts are linked to GPay only?

**Nithya:** Yes.

**Ruin:** So, how did you get to know about Google Pay?

**Nithya:** I mean, everybody around me were using it already. So, I got introduced through my family and my dad and brother were using it.

**Ruin:** So, generally I also started using that app for my payments. Makes sense. Also, I want to understand did you ever try using any other UPI apps?

**Nithya:** Yes, I did have PhonePay for a while. I mean, I still have it but I do not use it as much because I never had any issues with Google Pay and the interface is very I prefer the Google Pay interface and UI.

**Ruin:** Makes sense. So, what prompted you?

**Nithya:** It looks much simpler and because I am already used to it, me switching to another app is much of a hassle.

**Ruin:** So, I am just curious when you were already using Google Pay what prompted you to actually try PhonePay? What was the trigger?

**Nithya:** I think I had some cashback or something when I was buying something. They said if you pay through this, you might and I started seeing it often. So, I was like, my dad said try it for a few times.

**Ruin:** Got it. So, another question. Other than payments, do you use these apps for anything else?

**Nithya:** I pay for my mobile recharge, all that.

**Ruin:** So, did you naturally discover them through the app or did somebody tell you you could do them through these apps?

**Nithya:** Yeah, I noticed it on the app only. And it was much easier than going to the individual like Jio app and paying.

**Ruin:** Got it. So, you did mention you like cashbacks, etc. So, do you think Google is doing good in terms of cashback?

**Nithya:** No. I do get scratchcards or a thing, you know. But never really got much from them. And I see Paytm having a lot of offers these days too. But never noticed with Google Pay.

**Ruin:** So, these are the offers you see on different platforms, I assume, like online shopping or Swiggy, etc. Can you come again?

**Nithya:** So, where are you seeing these Paytm offers and these offers from?

**Ruin:** Amazon or like Nykaa When I'm just about to pay, it shows me the offers and cashbacks which I could get.

**Nithya:** Got it.

**Ruin:** So, have you ever had issues with payment?

**Nithya:** No. It's only usually when my bank is down. That's the only inconvenience I had with Google Pay.

**Ruin:** So, you never had to talk to support?

**Nithya:** Nope.

**Ruin:** Got it. Moving on with the conversation, talking about credit cards, what do you know about credit cards, Nithya?

**Nithya:** So, credit cards are basically instead of paying from your own money, you pay with the bank's money. And after a month, you have to pay back how much ever you have spent. And you will usually have a limit that you have to you can only spend this much per month. And as you keep being a good customer, like you pay them back on time, your credit limit keeps increasing.

**Ruin:** Understood. And also, I do hear a lot about you good offers on credit cards and then you get large access and all those things.

**Nithya:** That makes sense, Nithya. That is correct. Can I know where did you learn all this from?

**Ruin:** Yeah, usually friends and family from their experiences and also I get marketing mails from these HDFC and other companies on my mail and also on SMS.

**Nithya:** I see, I see. So yeah, they have all these catchy headlines. Get your credit limit, blah, blah, blah.

**Ruin:** So, do you think everybody uses a credit card?

**Nithya:** Do I think? Everybody uses a credit card generally.

**Ruin:** Sorry, I did not get that. Okay, let me rephrase that. What kind of person uses a credit card, according to you?

**Nithya:** What kind of a person uses a credit card? Okay. The most obvious use case would be when you are in an urgent need to make an expense but you do not have the money right now. So, maybe people who have a lot of expenses at the end of the month which they have to pay back but their salary comes next week so for now they use their credit cards and also people who also in general anybody who wants to have a good credit score because I have learned that a credit score is important for you to get a loan at a lower interest rate so those people also try to have a good credit history and yeah, on top of my mind that's what I think of.

**Ruin:** Got it, okay. So, do you have credit cards?

**Nithya:** Not yet.

**Ruin:** May I know why?

**Nithya:** Yeah, I never really had the necessary to have one. And I do not make much bigger purchases, usually I have enough money to make the expenses. And also getting a credit card and like maintaining it seems more effort to me.

**Ruin:** Okay. Yep. So, do your friends have credit cards?

**Nithya:** A few of them do.

**Ruin:** May I know what kind of cards they have?

**Nithya:** I am not really sure but if you want the bank names is usually HDFC or ICICI.

**Ruin:** Okay. Makes sense. So, your friends have cards so you never felt like I need one. Maybe not for purchases but let's say for lounge access, etc.

**Nithya:** No. I travel just 2-3 times per year. And that's usually not a situation where I am in an airport hours before so it is not really a factor for me to consider while getting a credit card. And also some cards really get complicated with like you have to do this much of spending then only you will have access and all that.

**Ruin:** Makes sense. This is a hypothetical question. So, if you were to design a credit card for people like you, what would be the rules and what would be the benefits that you would value the most?

**Nithya:** Okay. Because I do not have a credit card, I do not have much idea of how these things work presently. But then for me, you know, all my payments and everything being so convenient for me when I am having a bank account connected to my UPI, I think, you know, something as convenient as that would be helpful.

**Ruin:** Yeah. Another question just occurred to me. Do you know that there is a Rupay credit card and you can pay via UPI for that? Like you can scan QR codes and pay using that?

**Nithya:** No, I was not aware of this.

**Ruin:** Okay, Nithya. You can check it out. It's a cool feature where you can just link your credit card and then you can just scan a normal QR and just make payments and those payments happen through the credit card instead of your UPI.

**Nithya:** Okay. And they also remind me when I have to pay and when my billing cycle would be all that?

**Ruin:** Usually. Most of the apps they send you an email saying your statement is generated, etc. And you will be able to catch it if you look at your Gmail on time.

**Nithya:** Okay. Right. Cool. Yeah. I would like to check it out.

**Ruin:** That's all the questions I had for you, Nithya. Thank you very much again for taking your time.

**Nithya:** Yeah. No issues. Thanks.
