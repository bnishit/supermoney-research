# Part 1: Interview Summaries

## Sidh Interview Summary (19, Bangalore)

### Background
- 19-year-old, gym-goer, uses Instagram daily
- Has 3 bank accounts (2 ICICI, 1 SBI)
- Been using UPI apps for 2 years

### Payment Journey
1. **Started with Paytm** → Failed transactions frustrated him
2. **Tried SuperMoney** → Used for 6 months, earned ₹250-300 cashback
3. **Settled on GPay** → Zero failed transactions, clean UI

### SuperMoney Experience (Critical Feedback)
- **What worked:** Cashback rewards (~₹250-300 over 6 months)
- **What killed it:** App forced reinstalls 2-3 times to continue using
- **Current state:** Still receives cashback notifications, ignores them completely
- **Quote:** "SuperMoney still till date messages like you have 25 rupees... But I've just not paid attention to it much because it's very inconvenient."

### Credit Card Interest
- Wants HDFC Swiggy card (blocked by age requirement)
- Aware of FD-based cards but hasn't pursued
- Interested in building credit score early
- Friend (28) has SBI cashback card with 3% returns

### Key Behavioral Insight
Uses multiple apps strategically: GPay for daily spending, PhonePay for savings account. This is self-discovered behavior, not advised by anyone.

## Nithya Interview Summary (21, Gurgaon)

### Background
- 21-year-old, final year college student
- Lives in hostel
- Active investor (uses Kite/Zerodha)
- Shops across 6+ platforms for deals

### Payment Journey
1. **Introduced to GPay by family** (dad and brother)
2. **Tried PhonePay** → Prompted by cashback offer at checkout
3. **Stuck with GPay** → Habit, switching cost too high

### Credit Card Perception
- Good theoretical knowledge of how credit cards work
- Understands credit score importance
- **Barrier:** "Getting a credit card and maintaining it seems more effort to me"
- Doesn't see value in lounge access (only travels 2-3x/year)

### Key Discovery
**Did not know about Rupay credit cards on UPI** - Showed genuine interest when informed. This is a potential onboarding angle.

### Behavioral Pattern
- Prefers UPI over COD for hostel convenience
- Discovered mobile recharge feature organically in GPay
- Notices Paytm offers more than GPay cashbacks

# Part 2: Mom Test Evaluation

## The Mom Test Framework
*Based on Rob Fitzpatrick's book on customer conversations*

### Core Principles
1. **Talk about their life, not your idea**
2. **Ask about specifics in the past, not generics or opinions about the future**
3. **Talk less, listen more**
4. **Avoid leading questions**
5. **Don't pitch, learn**

---

## What Went Well ✅

### 1. Started with Open-Ended Life Questions
> "Can you walk me through your normal day and what apps do you use?"

This is textbook Mom Test - understanding their world before diving into payments.

### 2. Asked About Past Behavior (Not Hypotheticals)
> "Why did you choose GPay? Like you were using Paytm earlier..."

Good: Grounded in actual past decisions, not "would you use X?"

### 3. Followed Up on Interesting Threads
When Sidh mentioned using PhonePay separately, Ruin dug deeper:
> "Any particular reason why you wanted to shuffle it this way?"

### 4. Got Concrete Numbers
- Sidh's cashback amount: ₹250-300
- Duration of SuperMoney use: 6 months
- Number of reinstall frustrations: 2-3 times

### 5. Discovered Unasked Insights
- Sidh's multi-account strategy (self-discovered)
- Nithya's lack of awareness about Rupay on UPI

---

## What Went Wrong ❌

### 1. Leading Questions About SuperMoney
**Problem:** The interviewer prompted SuperMoney discussion rather than letting it emerge naturally.

> Ruin: "So do you know that even in UPI, you get cash back compared to like, these discount cards like SBI, etc?"

This led Sidh to mention SuperMoney, but we don't know if it was top-of-mind or prompted recall.

**Mom Test Violation:** Asking about your product/idea directly instead of discovering if they even think about it.

**Better approach:** "When you're deciding which payment app to use, what factors matter to you?" → Let cashback emerge (or not).

### 2. Pitched During Research (Nithya Interview)
**Problem:** Ruin taught Nithya about Rupay credit cards on UPI.

> Ruin: "Do you know that there is a Rupay credit card and you can pay via UPI for that?"

While this revealed she didn't know, it also:
- Introduced bias for future questions
- Shifted from learning to pitching
- Made her subsequent interest potentially influenced by the pitch

**Mom Test Violation:** "Don't pitch, learn."

**Better approach:** Note the knowledge gap silently, continue learning about her credit card barriers.

### 3. Asked Hypothetical Future Questions
**Problem:** "If you were to design a credit card for people like you..."

> Ruin: "So, if you were to design a credit card for people like you, what would be the rules and what would be the benefits?"

Nithya's answer was vague and non-committal because she's speculating, not recalling.

**Mom Test Violation:** Opinions about the future are worthless. Past behavior is truth.

**Better approach:** "Tell me about the last time you considered getting a credit card. What happened?"

### 4. Binary/Closed Questions
Multiple instances of yes/no questions that killed exploration:

> "So, both the accounts are linked to GPay only?" → "Yes"
> "So, you never had to talk to support?" → "Nope"

**Better approach:** "Tell me about the last time something went wrong with a payment."

### 5. Didn't Dig Into Pain Deeply Enough
When Sidh mentioned SuperMoney's reinstall issues:

> "It very frequently asked me to reinstall the app"

Ruin moved on. But this is GOLD. Questions to ask:
- "Walk me through what happened the first time"
- "What were you trying to do when it asked you to reinstall?"
- "Did you contact support? What happened?"
- "What did you think was happening?"

### 6. Accepted Surface-Level Answers
When Nithya said credit cards seem like "effort":

> "Getting a credit card and like maintaining it seems more effort to me"

This is a vague objection. What effort? Ruin accepted it.

**Better approach:** "What do you mean by effort? Walk me through what you imagine that looks like."

## What Can Be Improved 🔧

### 1. Remove Product Name from Script
Don't mention SuperMoney, cashback apps, or specific features until the user does. See if these topics emerge naturally.

**Current:** "Do you know apps that give UPI cashback?"
**Better:** "How do you decide which payment app to use for a transaction?"

### 2. Use the "Tell Me About the Last Time" Formula
Instead of asking what they think or would do:

| ❌ Don't Ask | ✅ Ask Instead |
|-------------|----------------|
| "Do you like cashback?" | "Tell me about the last time you got cashback. What happened?" |
| "Would you use a credit card?" | "Tell me about the last time you considered getting one." |
| "What features do you want?" | "What frustrated you the last time you made a payment?" |

### 3. Go Deeper on Emotional Moments
When users mention frustration, embarrassment, or delight - STOP and dig:

> Sidh: "The shopkeeper will just get a little suspicious if it's failing"

This is emotional! Questions to ask:
- "Tell me about a time that happened"
- "How did that make you feel?"
- "What did you do after?"

### 4. Separate Learning from Pitching
If you discover a knowledge gap (Nithya didn't know about Rupay UPI), note it for later. Don't teach during research - it contaminates the data.

### 5. Ask About Money Specifically
Neither interview asked:
- "How much money do you spend monthly via UPI?"
- "What's your biggest payment app transaction?"
- "Tell me about a time you needed to pay but couldn't"

These reveal actual behavior, not stated preferences.

### 6. Watch for Compliments (and Ignore Them)
When Sidh said SuperMoney cashback was "pretty good" but then described abandoning it - the behavior is the truth, not the compliment.

# Part 3: Learning Summaries

## Validated Learnings (Strong Evidence)

### 1. Convenience > Cashback
**Evidence:** Both users prefer GPay despite acknowledging other apps have better cashback.
- Sidh: Abandoned SuperMoney's ₹250-300 cashback for GPay's reliability
- Nithya: Notices Paytm offers but won't switch

**Implication:** Cashback alone won't win users. UX friction will lose them.

### 2. Technical Friction is Fatal
**Evidence:** Sidh's SuperMoney experience
- 2-3 forced reinstalls → Complete abandonment
- Still has unredeemed cashback → Won't return

**Implication:** Any friction that interrupts the core payment flow will cause churn regardless of rewards.

### 3. Family/Peer Influence Drives Adoption
**Evidence:**
- Nithya: "My dad and brother were using it"
- Sidh: Friend told him about SuperMoney
- Sidh: Friend's SBI card influenced his credit card interest

**Implication:** Word-of-mouth and family recommendations are primary acquisition channels for this demographic.

### 4. Credit Card Knowledge Gap Exists
**Evidence:**
- Nithya didn't know about Rupay on UPI
- Sidh thinks he needs to wait until 21 (not fully accurate)
- Both have vague understanding of FD-based cards

**Implication:** Educational content about credit cards for <21 could be valuable.

## Hypotheses to Test (Weak Evidence)

### 1. "Maintenance effort" is the real credit card barrier
Nithya mentioned this but wasn't probed. Need to understand what "effort" means specifically.

### 2. Multi-app usage is common
Sidh uses GPay + PhonePay strategically. Is this pattern widespread? Only n=1.

### 3. Lounge access isn't valuable to students
Nithya dismissed it due to travel frequency. Need more data points.

## Questions for Next Interviews

1. "Tell me about the last time an app asked you to do something annoying to continue using it. What happened?"

2. "Walk me through your last 5 payments. What app did you use for each and why?"

3. "Tell me about a time you wanted to buy something but couldn't pay for it the way you wanted."

4. "When was the last time you recommended a payment app to someone? What did you tell them?"

5. "Tell me about the last time you heard about a new payment feature. How did you hear about it?"

# Part 4: Research Quality Score

| Criteria | Score | Notes |
|----------|-------|-------|
| Open-ended questions | 7/10 | Good start, but too many closed questions later |
| Past behavior focus | 6/10 | Some good past questions, but hypotheticals crept in |
| Avoided pitching | 4/10 | Rupay UPI explanation was a pitch mid-interview |
| Depth of follow-up | 5/10 | Missed opportunities to dig into emotional moments |
| Concrete data gathered | 7/10 | Got good numbers on cashback, duration, etc. |
| Neutrality | 5/10 | Leading questions about cashback apps |

**Overall: 5.7/10**

The research gathered useful directional insights but left significant value on the table by not digging deeper into pain points and by introducing product concepts mid-interview.
