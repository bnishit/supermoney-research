**Rohit:** Hi Siddharth. Nice to meet you.

**Siddharth:** How's it going?

**Rohit:** I'm doing well. Good, good. So I'm just doing a small research to understand how teenagers handle payments etc. So I'll just be asking you a few questions. That'd be fine, right?

**Siddharth:** Yep.

**Rohit:** And this conversation will be recorded and will be used for research.

**Siddharth:** Yep.

**Rohit:** Okay. So can you walk me through your normal day and what all apps do you use throughout the day?

**Siddharth:** Apps in general or just payment apps?

**Rohit:** In general.

**Siddharth:** Right. So let's start off with my day. So most days of the week I go to college obviously. So my day starts out with preparing for university and then heading to university and I'm spending anywhere from maybe 2 hours to 8 hours in a day. It varies quite a lot. So once I come back, I have started a daily habit of going to the gym actually. And then I study once in a while when the occasion comes. I work on my side projects as well and I have a final year project going on as well which I work on my free time as well.

**Siddharth:** So the apps I use... to be quite frank with you, I don't use my phone as much as I use my PC. But on my phone, I would say I use YouTube the most but also not that much. Then the second most category of apps I would say is payment apps obviously because I use my phone mostly for payments. That's it.

**Rohit:** Makes sense. So when was the last time you paid for something?

**Siddharth:** I think matter of fact it was yesterday. It was supposed to be today but my bank balance ran out. So yeah, yesterday.

**Rohit:** Can I know what did you pay for if that's okay?

**Siddharth:** Yeah, this is actually for snacks at my canteen.

**Rohit:** So what did you use to pay for this thing? The app?

**Siddharth:** So I use an app called super.money. Have you heard of it?

**Rohit:** Yeah, I do. That's the one by Flipkart, I believe. And they have like a cashback thing on every payment.

**Siddharth:** The main reason why I use it. So yeah, I use it for pretty much like 95-99% of my payments.

**Rohit:** Makes sense. So where did you hear about this in the beginning? And why did you choose this as your app?

**Siddharth:** So what I heard about it was actually from a few of my friends. I had seen them using this app. And I had inquired about it, looked pretty interesting. And they told me about the cashback feature and all. That is primarily the main reason that I use it, because of the cashback.

**Rohit:** Got it. So was this the first app you were using? Or were you using something else before this?

**Siddharth:** I was actually... I initially got my bank account sorted. I started using GPay. And then after GPay for a while, I switched to super.money.

**Rohit:** Can you just walk me through what made you shift from Google Pay to super.money initially? What triggered you?

**Siddharth:** So it wasn't regarding GPay. The reason I switched was not pertaining to any shortcomings of GPay per se. It was mostly because super.money has a cashback feature. That is pretty much the only reason I switched to it. There's no other reason.

**Rohit:** Got it. So ever since you switched to the app, you are stuck to using super.money?

**Siddharth:** Yeah, I'm stuck to it. Pretty consistently. For most payments. There are still a few payments which, let's say like recurring payments and all... I have a few payments on GPay. For example, I still do my bank transfer on GPay. Like in between my banks.

**Rohit:** Can you explain more like why not on super.money? And why do you use GPay for bank transfers?

**Siddharth:** The main philosophy is that I have two bank accounts. And one of them I use for my daily transactions. And the other I use to hold like vast amount of other money. So as a sort of exercise in security, I guess you could say, I keep both banks on GPay, but only one bank on super.money. It's also a great way to reduce my spending as well. Because I don't want to be spending too much on a given day.

**Rohit:** Got it. Makes sense. So have you heard or used any other apps apart from these apps?

**Siddharth:** I think I have. I can't remember the names of any.

**Rohit:** That's okay. And going back to how you started using GPay. So why did you first think like "I should use GPay" instead of any other app out there? What triggered you? Or what was the journey of you installing that app?

**Siddharth:** If I remember correctly, it was the first app I had on my phone. And you know how, like I use an Android phone, right? So like, I would say Google has the most, the best integration out of any other service into the Android ecosystem. Like, for example, if you use an iPhone, you're more inclined to use Apple, whatever they have. This is the most well integrated service there is for that particular platform. I would say that's the main reason why I started using it.

**Siddharth:** And I would still say, okay, like, if super.money for whatever reason stops giving cashback, or it becomes more inconvenient to use, I would immediately switch back to GPay.

**Rohit:** So I think it's just far superior.

**Siddharth:** Okay. You feel it's superior because it's integrated into the Android ecosystem?

**Rohit:** Not just that. There's a lot of small user experience, design things that make... it just makes the quality of the app that much better than super.money, right?

**Rohit:** Interesting. If you may, can you just go deeper into why you think that way, or any specific reasons or features, what makes you feel that way?

**Siddharth:** I would say the number one thing that stands out to me is on GPay. Let's say, you can see the overall... on GPay, at the top of every month, you can see how much money I've spent or how much money you have gained in total, right? So in a month, you spend 500, but you gain 1000, on the GPay app at the top, it's like plus 500 in green. I think that's a very useful feature to know how much you're spending at a glance.

**Rohit:** So if I may ask, what is the biggest transaction you did using UPI?

**Siddharth:** Using UPI, I think around 70,000 rupees or 80,000 rupees. I believe there's a transfer limit of one lakh per day.

**Rohit:** Makes sense. So on a monthly basis, if I can ask, how regularly do you use UPI?

**Siddharth:** On a monthly basis, I would say the past year actually, I've been using UPI on a near daily basis. But I think ever since the new year, I've kind of stopped my spending. So it's been at least once every three, four days, I would say. It's not exactly like a linear thing. It's more, sometimes there are stretches that I pay pretty much every day. Sometimes I go a week without paying.

**Rohit:** Got it. And do you use these apps only for payments? Or do you use it for anything else?

**Siddharth:** Super.money, pretty much only for payments and cashback.

**Rohit:** What about Google Pay?

**Siddharth:** Google Pay, yeah, just for keeping checks and my balances and all that.

**Rohit:** Makes sense. Cool. Let's go into a different topic now. So you know about credit cards, right?

**Siddharth:** Yep, I do.

**Rohit:** Can you just tell me, what do you know about them?

**Siddharth:** So I know that you need to have an income, in most cases at least, to take a credit card or for banks to issue a credit card to you. I also know that it's like taking mini loans that you have to pay at the end of the month. If you don't repay, you accrue interest and that's how these banks essentially make money. That's what I know about credit cards.

**Rohit:** Where did you learn all this from?

**Siddharth:** Mostly through word of mouth, actually. My friends would be talking about credit cards and I just ask them, like, what is the need of a credit card? Why does such a thing exist?

**Rohit:** Got it. So have you ever tried getting one?

**Siddharth:** No, personally, I'm not really interested in a credit card.

**Rohit:** May I know why?

**Siddharth:** So the main thing I'm worried about is... I'm sure you've heard of it, but nothing in this world is truly free, right? So there's always a catch behind these credit services that these banks provide. They're essentially waiting for you to fall into the trap, right? And I just don't want to be a part of that system. At least for now.

**Siddharth:** I would also say that I don't think we have enough knowledge on this subject to confidently acquire a credit card.

**Rohit:** Got it. So do you think there's any age where you should start using credit cards?

**Siddharth:** I'm not sure. In an ideal world, it would really be ideal to spend within your limits, or spend within whatever income bracket you're in. So I would say there's no age where you should necessarily have to get a credit card, but if you really had to, then best to do that as soon as possible.

**Rohit:** So you did mention about your friends discussing about credit cards. What kind of discussions were these, and what were you discussing?

**Siddharth:** So these were actually mostly on the benefits of credit cards, and how certain companies tie up with credit card companies for benefits to those particular cardholders. Like, concessions on hotel fees, or discounts on airplane tickets, etc. Cashback rewards. So yeah, it's kind of a "you lose if you don't opt-in" kind of system, from what my friends have told me.

**Rohit:** So you think you would get a card for some of these benefits, or not?

**Siddharth:** I would definitely do a few calculations before I jumped into making the decision.

**Rohit:** Do your parents use credit cards?

**Siddharth:** No, not that I'm aware of, actually. My parents are actually very against taking loans of any kind, in general.

**Rohit:** Makes sense. One last question. Was there any time in the near past where you felt, "Oh, I wish I had a credit card at that moment?"

**Siddharth:** Not particularly. But there are instances, my friends, whenever we go out to eat, or we go to some fancy places, they use a credit card, and they get quite a lot of cashback. And I think to myself, in those kind of situations, it would be quite handy having a credit card at hand.

**Rohit:** Got it. But you never followed up to get that card yourself?

**Siddharth:** As I said, I'm not really eligible for a lot of credit cards.

**Rohit:** Why do you say that? What is the reason?

**Siddharth:** So if I'm not wrong, I think you need to show that you have an income to pay back, right? Because they don't want to give their money away willingly to any random person.

**Rohit:** Got it. Yeah, they need to have proof that you can actually pay back in case you go to debt. That's all the questions I had, Siddharth. I want to thank you again for taking your time for this survey.

**Siddharth:** Thank you.
