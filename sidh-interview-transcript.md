**Ruin:** Hey, Sid.

**Sidh:** Hey, how are you?

**Ruin:** I'm good. How are you?

**Sidh:** I'm good. I'm good.

**Ruin:** Okay. All right, Sid. I'm doing a small research to understand how teenagers handle payments. So I'll just ask you a few questions. Also this conversation will be recorded. So you'll find it.

**Sidh:** Yeah, yeah. That's it. That's it. Cool. And it'll be useful like internal research purposes. Oh, nice. Nice. Nice. All right. Got it.

**Ruin:** So let's start. Can you walk me through your normal day and what apps do you use on a daily basis?

**Sidh:** On a daily basis, I usually, unfortunately, it is Instagram quite a lot. But usually in the gym, I usually use heavy app. And usually after that, I go for some coconut water. So in that I use GPay to do the payment. And in the, I mean, YouTube also is one of them, primarily Jio. I use mainly those for entertainment. And yeah, mainly that's on a daily basis, actually.

**Ruin:** Understood. I see you mentioned GPay when you want to drink coconut water. So yeah. Why do you use GPay?

**Sidh:** The UI is like, too easy to use, like in PhonePay and all that. It's not as easy as GPay, GPay when I open is just right there, pay now, scan anything. And also I've never like faced any issues with GPay. Previously I used to use Paytm a lot. And Paytm for no reason, you should just simply keep failing at times and that got a little frustrating. So I just switched to GPay. And I don't think I've ever gotten a failed payment on GPay, honestly. That and PhonePay also same thing. I've never gotten a failed attempt on PhonePay. So usually these two are my go-to apps.

**Ruin:** Understood. That makes sense. So you value payment failure rates and all.

**Sidh:** Yeah. Because also, I mean, in India, like the shopkeeper will just get a little suspicious if it's failing a little too much. Yeah. That makes sense. Yeah. And GPay also like the history, right, that is like pretty clear. So that and also to check previous payments and all that. So that's why it's very useful that way.

**Ruin:** Got it. Got it. Okay. Like, why did you choose GPay? Like you were using Paytm, if I understand correctly, earlier. What prompted you to use GPay instead of some other app?

**Sidh:** I mean, see, honestly, I've tried all the apps, I've even tried random apps like SuperMoney. And then I tried GPay, PhonePay, Paytm, I've gone through all of these apps. And honestly, GPay is the one that I tried with me, because of all these, mainly it's just pretty clear. And also, it's also, I've heard it's used internationally. So I thought maybe if I have to send payments internationally, I'll just use GPay. Plus also, it's like widely accepted everywhere, right? So that's why I just chose GPay in that case.

**Ruin:** Understood. Understood. That makes sense. So you're not, you never even tried like switching apps from GPay to anything else. So only time you even use some other app for payment is PhonePay. I just want to understand, why did you want to use PhonePay instead of GPay in certain situations?

**Sidh:** So in my case, actually, I have multiple ICICI bank accounts. So now in that case, I just keep one of my accounts in PhonePay, ICICI account, and other ICICI account in GPay. And now PhonePay, I've kept like the account where I just keep money aside. So that's why I don't use that much. But GPay is my daily, this thing, using account. So that's why I just, that way I use GPay more. That's the only reason.

**Ruin:** That's an interesting perspective. Any particular reason why you wanted to shuffle it this way? Like, have you seen it somewhere or did someone advise you or something?

**Sidh:** No one has advised. This is all mainly from experience, because I've been using this UPI apps for two years. And honestly, initially, I did not like GPay, but then I used to use Paytm a lot. But then that got a little this thing, as I told you, the failed transaction and stuff like that. So now when GPay I switched, I no faced any of that mainly. So I just continued with that. And the reason why I shuffled it this way, I do not have any particular reason. I was just mainly more comfortable with GPay. So that's why I, this thing, just a second.

**Ruin:** Sure, sure. Makes sense.

**Sidh:** Extremely sorry for that. All right. So yeah, as I was saying, I just mainly, after switching from GPay, I just such a good experience that I was very comfortable using GPay only. And then PhonePay, I just happened to download and I just put my other account on that. Paytm has honestly lost all my trust and there's a lot of, because of how commonly Paytm is being used, I heard there's scams also going on Paytm, random stuff like that. So I just kept away from that.

**Ruin:** Got it. That makes sense. So let's move on the conversation. So let's say, if a payment goes wrong, right, like what do you first do and do you reach out to someone? What do you do actually?

**Sidh:** So I currently have three bank accounts. So now if I have two ICICI's and one SBI account, so now if the payment fails on one account first, I try to pay it through PhonePay. And if it's an ICICI issue, then I pay it on SBI. Now if both are down, then yes, I reach out to my mom. I'm like, yo, can I just, real quick, can you do this payment for me? And like that.

**Ruin:** Got it. So have you ever had to raise a complaint when something did not happen as you expected? To GPay support?

**Sidh:** No, no, never had an issue with that. Never had to go that far.

**Ruin:** Got it. Got it. So moving on, can you tell me, what do you know about credit cards?

**Sidh:** Credit cards, unfortunately, I do not know much, but I have heard that they give good discounts. I've talked to some other people who use these discounts and like benefits, actually. Like I've heard most of the credit cards, they give you like some exchange thing with Marriott points, which help you book like crazy good places, which I'm very looking forward to once I get my hands on a card. But that benefit, yeah, that benefit, plus also my friend, he owns a SBI cashback card. So now in that, from what I understand is any online payment, you get like around three percent cash back on it. And that's how I actually bought my cult pass. So I got a good, I think one or two K cash back on it, which was pretty good. So that's mainly, I just heard that it gives good cash back and stuff like that.

**Ruin:** Okay. That makes sense. So why don't you have credit cards yourself?

**Sidh:** No, no. Currently, I'm 19. So I'm just waiting for to turn 21. Actually, like when I open Swiggy every time, they keep putting it on my face that, yo, take our HDFC Swiggy card. And I'm really keen on it. And I clicked also like, I'm like, okay, let me get this. But then they were like, no, you have to be 21, which unfortunately I'm not. So I'll wait for that. But when speaking to a friend, he's like, you can get a card, but you'll have to probably put an FD down through that I can get. I heard I was like, cool, I'll research it later on. But I just did not bother this thing, looking more into it.

**Ruin:** Got it. But if given a chance, you're okay to take an FD based card?

**Sidh:** Yeah, honestly, I do not mind. And I would probably take it considering all the benefits. And also, I was thinking about the credit score. Someone told like, keep your credit score pretty high or start building it up from a young age. So that is definitely on the charts when I get a card.

**Ruin:** Makes sense. Makes sense. So do you know that even in UPI, you get cash back compared to like, these discount cards like SBI, etc?

**Sidh:** Yeah, yeah. Actually, I think I mentioned earlier SuperMoney, I think it's by Flipkart order. So they have heard they give cashbacks and I myself have redeemed around 250-300 rupees of cashback over a certain period of time. But honestly, the convenience, it just came down to convenience, like SuperMoney. Once in a way, it was like, you have to reinstall the app to again, continue using it, stuff like that. And it just lost me over there for some reason. But GPay never had an issue. So that's why I did not even bother using SuperMoney again. I still get like some rupees of cashback which I can redeem, but I still not done it. It just lost me.

**Ruin:** Sid, I think I lost you in the last sentence. Can you come again?

## Part 2 (Continued after connection drop)

**Ruin:** Yeah. I said I just lost you there. Can you just repeat what you were talking about SuperMoney app experience of logging in again?

**Sidh:** Definitely. So you had mentioned that if I was aware of these apps which provide cashback on UPI too. So in that case, my friend had told me about this SuperMoney. So I used it for a good time, I think a good six months so that I think I was able to get around 250 to 300 rupees of cashback. But after that, for some reason, like it very frequently asked me to reinstall the app and do some certain stuff to continue using the app. So now that honestly, after two times what happened, it just put me off and put me off as it was just an inconvenience. So after that, like I just stopped using that app mainly. But with GPay, I never had an issue. So SuperMoney still till date messages like you have 25 rupees, which you can redeem this that and all. But I've just not paid attention to it much because it's very inconvenient. Like you have to reinstall this that and all like all that is too much. So that's why I just switched to GPay fully.

**Ruin:** Got it, got it. So another question is, you mentioned your friend had a credit card. So he's of your same age, right?

**Sidh:** He is actually around 28. So I think he has a lot of experience with credit cards.

**Ruin:** Okay. 28 makes sense. And people around your age, what are they using any credit cards?

**Sidh:** No, no, unfortunately, my age guys are not yet 21. One of them is 22. But he I don't think so has yet taken a credit card. So he's also a little not informed on credit cards much. He also uses UPI.

**Ruin:** Got it. Got it.

**Sidh:** Funnily, we all use GPay.

**Ruin:** Makes sense. Thanks, Sid. This was really valuable feedback that you've given and the questions you had answered. It was awesome.

**Sidh:** No worries. Thank you. Thank you.

**Ruin:** Awesome. Hope this helps.

**Sidh:** Sure. Sure. I'll let you know about the research.

**Ruin:** Definitely. Cool then.

**Sidh:** Okay. Bye.
