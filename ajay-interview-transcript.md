**Rohit:** Hi Ajay.

**Ajay:** Hi Rohit. How is it going?

**Rohit:** It's going good. Alright, so I'm doing a small research to understand how teenagers handle payments. So I'll ask you a few questions.

**Ajay:** Sure, sure.

**Rohit:** And this conversation is being recorded.

**Ajay:** Yeah, no worries. I have the consent on it, no issues.

**Rohit:** Okay, it'll just be used for research. Got it. So to start, can you describe your normal day in life?

**Ajay:** Yeah, it generally goes good. Getting up in the morning, getting ready for work. We'll go to work and keep on working. Sometimes we're on a break, we use some payments, like we buy something. And finishing our work, get back to our places where we stay. Even in travels, you know, etc.

**Rohit:** You were telling me you work, where do you work? What work do you do?

**Ajay:** A tech-based company in a technical role. I'm working as a software intern at a company in Bangalore.

**Rohit:** So when does money usually show up in your day?

**Ajay:** Initially in my day, money shows up when I board the bus. So there I have to do a UPI payment, which is costing around 6 to 15 rupees. That is one mode of payment I use. And secondly, sometimes in my office, I use payments to buy some snacks, like chocolate or whatever, drinks or something. Then, and sometimes at night, mostly it's used on food basis.

**Rohit:** Got it. So you mentioned UPI, which one do you use? Which app?

**Ajay:** See, it depends. Generally, prior I used to use Google Pay. Now I'm mostly using PhonePe. These are the primary payments. And if sometimes offers hit, like you know, if they get any 20-30 rupees discount, I just go to those things, like sometimes Paytm and all.

**Rohit:** So why did you shift from Google to PhonePe?

**Ajay:** See, it's a general psychological perspective. Actually, what happened is that prior I didn't have PhonePe. After I downloaded this app and started using it, it became the default one. It's just a psychological aspect that I started using PhonePe. 80% I use PhonePe. Maybe sometimes Google Pay... and PhonePe doesn't work well sometimes, like the servers are not responding at all.

**Rohit:** So why did you install Google Pay in the first place?

**Ajay:** Initially, when I was in my teens, like 18 or 19, it was the primary app which was getting served. PhonePe also had it, but Google Pay was something like... I've seen many Google Pay ads. So that pulled me a lot towards itself. So I just downloaded it and started using it as a default.

**Rohit:** Where did you see the ads for Google Pay?

**Ajay:** See, there are QR codes in the shops which are primarily based on Google Pay. Most of the shops back in COVID used to use Google Pay. Then, sometimes even in cricket advertisements and TV advertisements, these things come.

**Rohit:** So if I can ask, what was the first payment app you downloaded?

**Ajay:** Might be Paytm. Yeah, it was Paytm.

**Rohit:** And from Paytm, why did you download another app?

**Ajay:** As I already mentioned, it's just a psychological aspect to have two to three things, whatever is possible. Like all the modes available for payment. And there are many things, they give offers initially. Generally, if we order Swiggy, if you're ordering food, we see that some particular app gives 25 rupees discount. That attracts me to download that app. And some give 75 rupees in the initial thing. So maybe because of that, we get to download the app. That is one major reason.

**Rohit:** So although you have all these apps, PhonePe is your primary app?

**Ajay:** Yeah, before it's PhonePe. Now I'm using Google Pay, Paytm. I have PhonePe now. Bharat Pay was also installed. And I used to have FamPay also. Now it's not, I'm not using it right now.

**Rohit:** When did you install FamPay?

**Ajay:** When I was in my teens, actually. Post-COVID, like 21, 22.

**Rohit:** What was your age roughly around then?

**Ajay:** So now I'm 22. So it was 18, 19.

**Rohit:** So you had used Paytm before FamPay?

**Ajay:** Yeah, yes, you're right.

**Rohit:** What made you install FamPay?

**Ajay:** Paytm was generally... see, I wasn't a legal holder of a bank account because I was 16 or 15 when I started using Paytm. It was my mother's account. My mother used to send me money on that. So I used to use it. But when FamPay just said it's a bank for teenagers, they provide a debit card. It has a limit, restrictions and all, where we cannot have higher limits. It's just a bank for teenagers. So that attracted me to use FamPay. We have that self-account thing. In teens, we have these aspects which attracts us towards it.

**Rohit:** Got it. Where did you hear about FamPay?

**Ajay:** If there were little advertisements... maybe in Instagram handles only. On Instagram handles, it used to show up. And then I used to have a small dig and research whether it's safe or not. And it was safe. They offered a good range of... a debit card was also offered.

**Rohit:** So you mentioned you did some research and you found it safe. Can you let me know what research you did and why did you conclude it was safe?

**Ajay:** Basically, we get many links, there are some third-party apps which ask to install them. They give higher credits. But most of them are spam or fraud cases are more. So FamPay is something like it has its own website. And primarily on App Store or Google Store, they give reviews on that. It's an App Store certified thing. And primarily, some of my teen friends also started using that app.

**Rohit:** So seeing the reviews on App Store, you felt it was safe and it had a website?

**Ajay:** Not like that. It was assured by some of the... like RBI. It had the regulations and all. It was registered with that, right? So that was the primary aspect. Not like App Store... to check the performance of the app, how it helps us.

**Rohit:** Got it. So you use UPI apps on a daily basis?

**Ajay:** Yeah, obviously. At least once in a day, for sure. It's actually replaced cash, most probably.

**Rohit:** Makes sense. What is the biggest transaction you did?

**Ajay:** This is a tricky one. Somewhere between 90,000, 99,000, whatever limit was possible.

**Rohit:** If I may know, what did you use that for?

**Ajay:** It was used for my college fees or some of my semester fees because it was only 1 lakh a day. So if the fees is 1,50,000 or something, I used to pay 98,000 or 99,000 at one day and the other payment another day.

**Rohit:** So when was the last time you recommended a payment app to someone?

**Ajay:** Maybe back in four or five years ago when my friends didn't have these things. I guess I have recommended them Google Pay.

**Rohit:** I know it's in the past, but if you can remember, why did you suggest them to use Google Pay?

**Ajay:** See, the thing is that Paytm and the prior thing, it had some issues, like server issues sometimes. But Google Pay, I found that it was fine. And even if the payment gets stuck or something, it gives us a thing. But in Paytm, we get to know maybe 20-30 minutes late. But in Google Pay, it gives a clear thing, like payment is under processing or something. Paytm gets stuck sometimes. Like prior, not now. Now it's fine.

**Rohit:** Let's go ahead in the conversation. Let's talk about credit cards. What do you know about credit cards?

**Ajay:** See, the thing is, basically they provide a limit, let's assume 50,000 or something. So we can use it for transactions where we can pay them and we have to pay those bills later. But if we use 20 or 25% of the limit, the credit score will be better. So it is provided on a credit score basis. If the credit score is above 730 or 750, we'll get a good limit. Not sure of that number also because I'm not using one now.

**Rohit:** That's okay. Where did you learn about all this stuff about credit cards?

**Ajay:** Generally, we see these in delivery stations. Mostly these SBI agents, State Bank of India agents are always there. So they always... not only that, even in malls also, we see some private banks where they'll be offering their services. They just check the credit score and tell us what is possible, if it is possible, what is the procedure allowed. And me being... prior I was not employed, right? So I had the urge, like I could take a credit card and pay later, which is on the pocket money which I receive. So if sometimes the budget of the money gets fluctuated, in those cases, yeah.

**Rohit:** Makes sense. So did you not try applying for a credit card?

**Ajay:** I did, I did. Actually, I have got a Bajaj EMI card, which has a limit of something. But no, I'm not yet applied for a credit card.

**Rohit:** So what is this other card you mentioned about?

**Ajay:** Bajaj Finance card. It is an EMI card where we can purchase electronic gadgets, daily utility things, automobiles, like scooties and all. We can pay on like a down payment. For example, let's assume I'm buying an iPhone of 80,000 rupees. I have to pay 30,000 down payment and the other 50,000 would be directed in EMIs with maybe a marginal interest of one or two percent.

**Rohit:** Where did you get to know about this Bajaj card?

**Ajay:** It was the ad service only. They used to offer me these things, the limit is possible and all. If we just click on this Bajaj app, it redirects to its official website, where it checks our limit and just tells that it was eligible. I was trying this from 19, but I received it when I was 21, maybe one, one and a half year ago.

**Rohit:** So you didn't apply for any normal credit cards?

**Ajay:** Apply, I guess I've done it recently. In PhonePe app, it was providing me one thing. So I just submitted that application. I didn't still get a response for it because I guess my credit score is somewhere between 740, I guess. So maybe because of that thing.

**Rohit:** So why did you decide you have to get the PhonePe credit card?

**Ajay:** I didn't decide, actually. See, frankly, I use some applications like Cred and SnapMint for these EMI purposes. If I have to buy something... as I said, I've just started my career, right? So I have a limited amount of salary. So if expenses are off my budget, I have to just plan these expenses. SnapMint gives a limit of 2000 initially, but based on our use, I got a limit of 2000, but now I have a limit of 10, 12,000 because I pay EMIs on time. And Cred also... this is only for EMI basis. SnapMint, even it provides money also, but it's for higher interest. But coming on to Cred, it provides money on a marginal rate of interest. If you're taking a loan of 20,000, you need to pay 21 or 22,000 in return in eight or nine months. So I felt if a credit card is there, I could just directly use it on things instead of these third-party apps.

**Rohit:** So let's say you saw in PhonePe that you are eligible for a credit card. What made you click and continue that process?

**Ajay:** Mostly the thing is that PhonePe is one of the most trusted apps in India. So if they're offering me something and if I have a need for that, so that made me do it.

**Rohit:** And coming back to the SnapMint and Cred, where did you hear about them first time?

**Ajay:** SnapMint, one of my friends used it. So he suggested me that thing. Cred also was a suggestion only, I guess.

**Rohit:** So do your friends have credit cards?

**Ajay:** Not sure. I never asked. This topic never came between us.

**Rohit:** So in the past, was there a time where you wish, "Oh, I wish I had a credit card right now" kind of moment?

**Ajay:** Yeah, many times. Sometimes when I want to buy clothes for some event, but I'm out of budget. For example, today is the first Feb, right? I have an event on third Feb. I have to buy some clothes, but I'll get money somewhere between 15th or 16th Feb. So I cannot wait till that. I have to lend from someone. Instead of lending with someone, if I'm taking it from this credit card, it's like a secret thing, right? It'll be between me only. If I'm lending with someone, let's assume I'm lending from my brother. So it is something different. This is between me only, one on one.

**Rohit:** Got it.

**Rohit:** So do you think credit cards are scary also?

**Ajay:** Yeah, seriously. See, maybe let's assume I've done a late payment. Some banks charge too high costs, right? And even the credit score goes down. If the credit score is going down, it might be a big issue. For example, I want to apply for a home loan. It plays a vital role, right? If my credit score is low, they'll offer me a loan maybe at very high interest rates, 13, 14 or 15% also sometimes. So it is scary sometimes. What I feel is, we have to take it according to what we can afford only. If I'm only getting 30,000, 10 or 20,000 is fine. Not more than that.

**Rohit:** In a credit card, what are the kind of benefits you expect that would attract you?

**Ajay:** If credit card... most probably if they provide 0% interest, like if you're paying in a lower amount of time, most probably some cards do that. And the second thing is that, you know, they can increase the limit. Now it's like if we use 25% of that credit limit, then only the credit score is good. So if that is increased to 30 or 40, it gives us a good leverage to spend money. And if the limit is good, sometimes it is...

**Rohit:** That's all the questions I had, Ajay. Thank you for taking your time to answer.

**Ajay:** No worries. My pleasure. Thank you.
